181. 1604 Court-ordered inspection.

(1) Records at principal office. If a corporation does not allow a member who complies with s. 181.1602 (1) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the circuit court for the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office is located may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation’s expense upon application of the member.

(2) Other records. If a corporation does not within a reasonable time allow a member to inspect and copy any other record, the member who complies with s. 181.1602 (2) and 

(3) may apply to the circuit court for the county where the corporation’s principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office is located for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.

(3) Payment of costs. If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it shall also order the corporation to pay the member’s costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it refused inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis for doubt about the right of the member to inspect the records demanded.

(4) Restrictions on distribution of records. If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may impose reasonable restrictions on the use or distribution of the records by the demanding member.
