181.0720 Members’ list for meeting.

(1) List of members. After fixing a record date for a notice of a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all of its members who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list must show the address and number of votes each member is entitled to vote at the meeting. The corporation shall prepare on a current basis through the time of the membership meeting a list of members, if any, who are entitled to vote at the meeting, but not entitled to notice of the meeting. This list shall be prepared on the same basis as and be part of the list of members.

(2) Inspection before meeting. The list of members must be available for inspection by any member for the purpose of communication with other members concerning the meeting, beginning 2 business days after notice is given of the meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation’s principal office or at a reasonable place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A member, a member’s agent or a member’s attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to ss. 181.1602 (3) and 181.1605, to copy the list, at a reasonable time and at the member’s expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

(3) Inspection at meeting. The corporation shall make the list of members available at the meeting, and any member, a member’s agent or a member’s attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

(4) Refusal to allow inspection. If the corporation refuses to allow a member, a member’s agent or a member’s attorney to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting or to copy the list as permitted under sub. (2), the circuit court for the county where a corporation’s principal office, or if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application of the member, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation’s expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete and may order the corporation to pay the member’s costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred to obtain the order.

(5) Effect of noncompliance. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the list of members does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.
